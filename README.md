# Attritiontrader

About 20% of Manifold markets take the form "Will [EVENT] happen by [DATE]." In theory, when the event in question is unscheduled, the probabilities in these markets should slope gradually downwards over the course of their lifespan. The event has failed to happen and the remaining time for it to do so has diminished. 

In practice this is too much rote work for traders to bother with, and the probabilities on these markets decrease in stops and starts.

This bot checks up on a list of such markets and periodically adjusts the probability downwards after periods of inactivity.

# Also included

Also included is a tool for rapidly viewing and categorizing markets, under the /marketpicker folder. It's presently in a primitive state and needs to be hosted on localhost to run.

# More to Come

I currenty intend to add additional trading strategies to this repository so that multiple can be run from a single program / bot account.
